- # Low-Stakes Activities

## Collaborative Annotations

For critical readings linked in the [schedule](https://zmuhls.github.io/ccny-data-science/schedule/), please use Hypothesis to annotate the text so that you can share your insights with peers and myself as part of our private annotation group. Annotations should range from 25 to 75 words, focusing on analytical depth, stylistic clarity, and interaction with peers. Hypothesis will serve not only as a platform for engaging with readings but also as a tool for managing and reflecting on scholarly information.

If you have not yet joined our private annotation group or cannot see your annotations, please do not hesitate to contact me; failing that, check out the [Hypothesis help](https://web.hypothes.is/help/) portal for support.
