## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamental concepts and computational techniques of data science to all students, including those majoring in the Arts,  Humanities, and Social Sciences. Students engage with data arising from  real-world phenomena—including literary corpora, spatial datasets, and  social networks data—to learn analytical skills such as inferential  thinking and computational thinking.

The competencies learned in this course will provide  students with skills that will be of use in their professional careers,  as well as tools to better understand, quantitatively and qualitatively, the social world around them. Finally, by teaching critical concepts  and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, the class  prepares students for further coursework in technology-aware fields of  study, from Python programming and cultural analytics to the big  umbrella of the Digital Humanities. The course is therefore designed for students who are new to statistics and programming. Students will make  use of the Python programming language, but no computer science  pre-requisites are required.

This course does **not** satisfy degree requirements for Computer Science students, who should *not* be enrolled in this course.
