## Course Description

Over the semester, students will engage with a variety of datasets—ranging from literary corpora to social networks—to develop skills in computational and inferential thinking. The course is structured around key themes such as data ethics, digital humanities, and network analysis, with practical activities and projects reinforcing these concepts. Students will learn to use essential tools like GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python libraries, enabling them to navigate and contribute to data-driven fields.

Each class session builds on previous material, with readings, coding exercises, and critical discussions that deepen students' understanding of both the technical and theoretical dimensions of data science. The course also emphasizes critical perspectives on data practices, encouraging students to interrogate the social, ethical, and cultural implications of data science in today's world.

The course schedule includes activities such as Python scripting, data visualization, and sentiment analysis, culminating in a final project where students create a social coding portfolio. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the technical skills and critical insights necessary for advanced study in technology-aware disciplines, including digital humanities and cultural analytics.

This course does **not** satisfy degree requirements for Computer Science students, who should *not* be enrolled in this course.
