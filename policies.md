# Class Policies ⚐

> **Respect and accountability are crucial to productive class discussions.** As co-producers of knowledge, I am expecting that we will practice respect for each other and be accountable to our words and actions. The classroom space is a learning space that can be, at times, uncomfortable, especially as we speak through our different perspectives and experiences. As long as we strive to be respectful to each other and accountable to the opinions, comments, questions, and concerns we share, this learning space will become a great place for us to nudge our boundaries. 
>
> **Attendance and participation is required.** Learning a new programming language requires consistent practice and your understanding of the material will be greatly facilitated by your participation in class. Students are expected to come to class prepared, which includes completing the assigned reading before class and being ready to engage in class discussions.   
>
> **Absences.** If you are unable to attend class, please email me in advance. If you are unable to email me in advance, please let me know as soon as it is possible. I do not require proof and would just need to know if you are not going to be in class. You may miss up to 3 classes. Missing more than 3 classes may impact your grades in class.    
>
> **Plagiarism and academic integrity.** Plagiarism is copying and using other people’s words without proper acknowledgment or citation as it is indicated in the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity. All writing submitted for this course is understood to be your original work. Knowing acts of plagiarism carry serious consequences that may result in required resubmission, a failing grade, or worst. If I suspect your writing or work is plagiarized, then I will request a consultation with you to discuss the matter, at which point we will discuss next steps with care and best intentions in mind. In return, I expect that you will take time to read and more importantly adhere to [CCNY’s Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy/).
>
> **Generative AI Policy**. For permission to use large language models (LLMs) or generative artificial intelligence for programming activities or reflections, please write an email or speak with me in person about your interest in the technology. With that condition satisfied , I politely request that when you use ChatGPT-4x or Gemini you also share a link to the conversation or enclose a screenshot of the prompts used to generate output whether it be text, code, or multimedia. See the citation below for one such case where coauthorship of an image is attributed to ChatGPT-4.0 and myself, with the conversation linked after the date of use.

> > Muhlbauer, Zachary and ChatGPT-4.0. "AI Hype 2050." OpenAI, July 2024, Input: *Generate an image for a syllabus section that humorously makes light of AI hype in the year 2050.*  
> 
> **Grading policy.** I use a 100% grading scale to assess final course grades, which correlates with the 1000 total points that you can earn from class proceedings. If you have a question or concern about your grade in the class, please bring it to my attention  immediately.

>|             | *B+  87-89* | *C+  77-79* | *D+  67-69* |
> | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
>| *A  93-100* | *B   83-86* | *C   73-76* | *D   60-66* |
> | *A- 90-92*  | *B-  80-82* | *C-  70-72* |             |

> When learning a new area of study in addition to a programming language, it is inevitable that we end up with mistakes or “fail” to obtain our desired ends. For this reason and others, grades are awarded primarily on process and effort rather than accuracy or "correctness," with ample opportunities to participate in seminar and lab meetings.
