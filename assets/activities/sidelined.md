Semester Reflection
Due on 05/21 (Tuesday) by class time
Throughout the semester you have been reading, watching, listening, and thinking about the
various aspects of doing a data science project. For your reflection, you will draw
connections between the topics, methods, and datasets we have used in class, and
consider how it can apply to your life experiences.
The reflection should not just be a description of the materials or just a recount of what you think
and feel. It should begin with a clear line of thought and use of examples (class materials and
discussions) to illustrate your reflections and an analytical approach. You may also include
examples from your lived experiences, current events, and related media. Even if you do not
plan to go on to explore data science further, consider how what you have learned in class can
apply to other experiences.
