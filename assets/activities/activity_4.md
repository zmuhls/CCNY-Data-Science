# Activity 4: Python Documentation and Tutorial
## Instructions
In this activity, you will create a clear, beginner-friendly tutorial on writing a for loop in Python or an equivalent lab topic of your choosing. 

More specifically, topics for your Python tutorial may include but are not limited to:
* conditionals
* comparisons
* string methods
* writing to csv files
* for loops
* functions
* version control
* data cleaning
* data collection
* data analysis
* text analysis

Be mindful of discourse conventions used in existing Python documentation on your topic. Those conventions may involve formatting and style choices that range from in-line commenting and indentation to sentence structure, punctuation, and tone.

Please address the following criteria as part of your tutorial:
    1. Explain the definition and purpose of the Python script
    2. Key components of the script discussed line by line
    3. A practical example of the Python code in action

### Submission Instructions

    Upload your work to the "Activities" folder in your social coding portfolio on GitHub, submitting two files altogether:
        (1) one-page reflection in Markdown (e.g., `a4_reflection.md`).
        (1) Jupyter notebook file with the completed tutorial (e.g., `a4_tutorial.ipynb`).
